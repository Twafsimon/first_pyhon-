Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much\n
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me\n
Lonely rivers flow to the sea
To the sea
To the open arms of the sea\n
Lonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me
Wait for me"
I'll be coming home
Wait for me\n
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much\n
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
